.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Call hostmux followed by a list of hosts you want to connect to via ssh.
The script will create a new tmux session with a split pane for each
specified host and connect to it.
.PP
You can then use the synchronize-panes feature of tmux to
multiplex/broadcast commands to all split panes / servers
.PP
Its arguments are as follows:

\fB\-s\fR
Specify a name for the tmux session. It defaults to

which means that you can have only one hostmux session at a time if you don't
specify unique names for your sessions
.TP 8n
\fB\-l\fR
Specify a valid tmux layout e.g. even-horizontal, tiled, etc. It defaults
to
\(oqeven-vertical\(cq
.TP 8n
\fB\-x\fR
Close the pane and/or session automatically when the ssh session
exits successfully
.TP 8n
\fB\-h\fR

.TP 8n
\fIhost\fR
Specify a space separated list of one or more user@hostname ssh targets. This
is what you would pass to the ssh command when you are connecting
to a host. Currently there is no support for passing additional flags
to ssh. If you do need them, add them to your ~/.ssh/config
